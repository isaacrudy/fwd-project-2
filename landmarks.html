                Mount Fairweather sits on the boarder of British Columbia and
                Alaska at a monumental 4,653m of elevation. It is one of the
                largest coastal mountain in the world, and certainly the largest
                in British columbia. The mountain was given the name,
                Fairweather, by Captain James Cook, and the earliest people have
                managed to climb it in recorded history was in 1931. It remains
                a beautiful sight to behold and many travel to the northern
                parts of British Columbia to enjoy the amazing view. To learn

                Mount Waddington is perhaps less well known than the previous
                two, though it rises to a height of 4016m, taller even than
                Mount Robson. It sits on the west coast of BC and is the largest
                mountain, completely within BC, along that coast. Once called
                the mystery mountain, it was renamed after Alfred Waddington.

                Okanagan Lake was formed through the movements of glaciers.
                Carved into the land, the lake has an approximate area of 350
                square kilometers, and is often incredibly deep very near the
                shore. The lake borders several communities, including the city
                of Kelowna, and is often visited by boaters who want to explore

                Within British Columbia's many mountains lie many dormant, and
                some not so dormant, volcanoes. Though even many residents don't
